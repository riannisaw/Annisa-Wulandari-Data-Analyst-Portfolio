# Annisa Wulandari - Data Analyst Portfolio
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## About Me
Hi, I’m Annisa. I’m a Communication Science graduate with a growing interest in data and analytical work. Through my major, I learned how communication, audience behavior, and messaging can be understood through data, and I further strengthened this interest by independently learning Excel, SQL, Tableau, and basic statistics. I enjoy exploring how data can support clearer decisions, effective communication, and business or organizational goals.

During my academic and practical experiences, I worked with reporting, documentation, content performance analysis, and basic data handling. These experiences helped me develop a structured way of thinking, attention to detail, and the ability to translate information into actionable insights both for communication strategies and operational needs.

Outside of formal work, I continue to learn and practice data analysis tools while applying them to real projects. I’m comfortable working independently or in a team, and I’m motivated by the process of turning information into insights that support better decisions and measurable outcomes.
